# Movies-ETL

## Purpose
This project consisted of applying our knowledge of Python regular expressions, functions, and SQL to perform an extract, transform and load data into a PostgreSQL database. We took movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle along with ratings data and used regular expressions along with functions to help clean up our data so that all columns are consistent throughout. Once our data was cleaned using the functions created, we used pandas to import the cleaned movies and ratings data to PostgreSQL to create the new database.
